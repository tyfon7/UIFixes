Existing SPT features made better

#### Inventory

-   Customizable mouse scrolling speed
-   Moving stacks into containers always moves entire stack

-   Sorting will stack and combine stacks of items
-   Shift-clicking sort will only sort loose items, leaving containers in place

#### Inspect windows

-   Show the total stats (including sub-mods) when inspecting mods (optional, toggleable _in_ the inspect pane with a new button)
-   See stats change as you add/remove mods, with color-coded deltas
-   Remember last window size when you change it, with restore button to resize to default
-   Move left and move right buttons + keybinds to quickly snap inspect windows to the left or right half of the screen, for easy comparisons
-   Auto-expand descriptions when possible (great for showing extra text from mods like Item Info)
-   Quickbinds will not be removed from items you keep when you die

#### Traders

-   Autoswitch between buy and sell when you click trader items or control-click your own items
-   Autoselect quest items when turning in
-   Repair window remembers last used repairer, and actually updates the repair amount when you switch repairers

#### Flea market

-   Auto-expand categories when there's space to do so
-   Locked trader item tooltip reveals which specific quest will unlock it
-   Option to keep the Add Offer window open after placing your offer
-   Set prices in the Add Offer window by clicking the min/avg/max market prices (multiplies for bulk orders)
-   Autoselect Similar checkbox is remembered across sessions and application restarts
-   Replace barter offers icons with actual item images, plus owned/required counts on expansion
-   Clears filters for you when you type in search bar and there's no match

#### Weapon modding/presets

-   ✨ Weapons can grow left or up, not just right and down
-   Enable zooming with mousewheel
-   Skip needless unsaved changes warnings when not actually closing the screen

#### Hideout

-   Remember window state when you leave hideout without closing (e.g. when searching for a recipe item on flea)
-   Tools used in crafting will be returned to the container they were in

#### In raid

-   ✨ Quickbind tactical devices to control them individually
-   Reloading will swap magazines in-place, instead of dropping them on the ground when there's no room
-   Grenade quickbinds will transfer to the next grenade of the same type after throwing
-   Option to change the behavior of the grenade key from selecting a random grenade to a deterministic one

#### Mail

-   The messages window stays open when you return from transfering items

#### Misc

-   Confirm dialogs with Return/Enter/Space instead of just Y
-   Close modal dialogs by clicking outside of them
-   Sensible autofocus of textboxes in various dialogs
-   Many little UI tweaks to tighten up the graphics

## Fixes

Fixing bugs that BSG won't or can't

#### Inventory

-   Fix item tooltips disapparing if your mouse goes through the Quest/FoundInRaid icon (great for MoreCheckmarks)
-   Fix windows appearing partially offscreen

#### In raid

-   Remove the unimplemented door actions like "Bang & clear" that are never going to happen
-   Fix the keybind for weapons always showing up as 1, 2, and 3. Now shows your actual keybind like every other slot
-   Fix the quick item bar not respecting "Autohide" and "Never show" setting

#### Mail

-   "Receive All" button no longer shows up when there is nothing to receive
